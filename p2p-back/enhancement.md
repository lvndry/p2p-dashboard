# Enhancement

Possible improvements that can be done to the API:

- /myinfo should be a GET request. session_token can be located in the header instead

- Run server on more appropriate port (e.g 8080). Frontend apps usually run on port 3000 in localhost.

- CORS <3

- In README precise that in response of `/bandwith` with receive an array of arrays wih [timestamp, CDN] or [timestamp, P2P]
